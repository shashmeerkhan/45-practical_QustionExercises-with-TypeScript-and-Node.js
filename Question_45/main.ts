// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
//  The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept
//  an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information
//  and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object
//   thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
